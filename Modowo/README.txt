WELCOME  to the not Ratchet And Clank Quake 4 Mod:

Changes in the mod:

Text has been changed throughout,
Game is now in Third Person at start up,
Third Person mode now has a Gui,
Gui Is shifted to the top of the screen(Atleast part of it) AND a different color,
Now start the game with Gauntlet(Wrench) and Blaster(Dual vipers but not really),
Wrench attacks each time you click, holding down attack does no damage, range increased on wrench,
Dual Vipers Shoot Really fast but does little to no damage,
Focus Point in third person has been set to zero, allowing aiming up and down without turning the camera all the way ( Very Strange),
Napalm Gun is now almost a lava gun, will maybe crash the game sometimes,
All Guns now have no clipsize, so they fire directly from the stockpile,
-----
LEVELING SYSTEM
You gain exp each time a enemy dies, regardless of if you killed them or what weapon you used,
You level up like every 3 enemy deaths, increasing/ decreasing the efficieny of weapons with each level,
When you level up the following will be changed(Couple Exceptions here and there):
Increase in projectile count(Some guns might crash the game at some point lol)
Increase in Damage(Weapons have much lower base damage to account for this)
Increase in spread
-----
MOVEMENT SYSTEM
The crouch button has been replaced with what is basically the clank movement button(That's right this is r&c ps4 rules)
No more fall damage,
You move faster,
If you stand still and press/hold crouch, you will launch high into the air(Crouching High Jump),
If you are moving forward and press/hold crouch, you will lunge forward in that direction(Lunge Jump),
